# ScrumDo_Android
Project for CMSC 191 - Mobile Development

  ScrumDo allows the user to keep track of the tasks in a specific project. When a user logs in, a page with different cardboards will appear. Each cardboard represents a project. Once selected, the user will be redirected to the To-Do- Doing- Done page.
